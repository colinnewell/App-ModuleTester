Test-* distributions broken by Test::Builder 1.5


As of 63606c6 this is the list of Test-* distributions whose tests have been broken by Test::Builder 1.5. 104 out of 722 distributions are broken.

A test is "broken" if it passes with stable and fails with the latest Test::Builder 1.5.

They mostly fall into these categories...

Failures in the test suite due to small changes in the TAP format
Using private methods of Test::Builder which no longer exist
Using Test::Builder->details() which is no longer populated by default
Doing something complicated to the Test::Builder internals
To help...

Download the module from CPAN
Run it with Test::More 0.98 to verify it works
Run it with Test::More from the Test-Builder1.5 branch
At that point you can...

Patch the problem
Send the patch to the module
Open an issue stating you've sent on a patch
Indicate whether your patch was only to the test suite or required fixing runtime code
Or if it works now...

Open an issue and let us know the distribution and version which works.
Or if the problem is over your head...

Open an issue with the distribution, version and test failure output.
